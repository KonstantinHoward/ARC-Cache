# ARC-Cache
Simulation of ARC Caching Algorithm collaborating with @gleising and @Aidan-Walsh
## 
The Adaptive Replacement Cache is an innovative caching algorithm developed by IBM in the early 2000s. See the original paper, which we used as a guide, [here](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast03/tech/full_papers/megiddo/megiddo.pdf). It uses both LRU and LFU lists whose sizes adapt according to the needs of the workload. Our implementation is a simulation of this algorithm using Golang. We analyzed its performance in comparison to LRU and LFU caching algorithms using workloads generated by the trace [webcachesim](https://github.com/dasebe/webcachesim).
